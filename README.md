# I Don't Even Know
_I maybe currently [streaming it](https://www.twitch.tv/qatim), I may not be idek lol_

This was created in 3 hours for fun. The idea was stolen from
[Rox](https://twitter.com/RoxCodes/)'s [Twitch
Difussion](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchdiffusion). He made something very
similar on stream and wanted to see how quick I could recreate it for fun.

This of course isn't the best code ever written, but YOLO it was for fun lol.

I used Open AI because I have free start-up credits from Microsoft Founders
program.

100% self contained in a single docker image, about 1vCPU @ 512 MB of RAM.
